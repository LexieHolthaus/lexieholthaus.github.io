  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I’m Alexandria “Lexie” Holthaus, a physicist, community advocate, and now a candidate for Congress. I believe in science-based policy, economic justice, and bold climate action.</p>

  <h2>Platform</h2>

  <h3>✅ A Green, Just Future</h3>
  <p>We need bold climate leadership now. I support a Green New Deal that invests in renewable energy, creates good-paying union jobs, and ensures no community is left behind in our transition to a sustainable economy. Climate justice is economic, racial, and generational justice.</p>

  <h3>✅ Healthcare Is a Human Right</h3>
  <p>No one should go bankrupt because they got sick. I believe in Medicare for All — a single-payer system that guarantees comprehensive healthcare to every American. It’s time to put people over profits and ensure care, not coverage.</p>

  <h3>✅ Housing for All</h3>
  <p>Everyone deserves a safe, affordable place to call home. I support policies that expand affordable housing, strengthen tenant protections, and invest in public housing. Housing is a human right — not a commodity for corporate profit.</p>

  <h3>✅ Economic Justice</h3>
  <p>I’m fighting for a fair economy that works for working people — not just the wealthy few. That means raising the minimum wage to a living wage, taxing the ultra-rich, protecting the right to organize, and investing in green union jobs.</p>

  <h3>✅ Racial and Social Equity</h3>
  <p>We must dismantle systemic racism across every institution — from policing to education to healthcare. That means investing in marginalized communities, ending mass incarceration, and building systems rooted in justice and dignity.</p>

  <h3>✅ Education for the Many</h3>
  <p>Public education is the foundation of a fair society. I support tuition-free public college and trade school, cancellation of student debt, and robust funding for K–12 schools — especially in under-resourced communities.</p>

  <h3>✅ A Just Foreign Policy</h3>
  <p>America must lead with diplomacy, human rights, and peace — not endless wars. I support a foreign policy grounded in accountability, multilateralism, and justice for oppressed peoples around the world.</p>

  <h3>✅ Democracy That Works for All</h3>
  <p>Our democracy is under threat. I support protecting and expanding voting rights, ending partisan gerrymandering, and getting big money out of politics. It’s time to build a government that answers to the people — not corporations or billionaires.</p>
