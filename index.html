<section id="about">
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>My name is Alexandria “Lexie” Holthaus. I've been a physicist, educator, data scientist, and now a congressional candidate. Unlike most of my peers, I overcame childhood learning disabilities, poverty, and the stigma of being “different.” I know firsthand the value of hard work, persistence, and believing in the potential of those who are too often overlooked.</p>

  <p>After earning my bachelor’s in astrophysics and master’s in physics from the University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa — where I worked on cutting-edge research in astrophysics and space weather — I began working on real-world logistics simulations. My research has spanned everything from neutron monitor calibration using data from the International Space Station to computational simulations of stellar evolution. Through it all, I’ve remained driven by one thing: a deep love of learning and a belief in the power of science to improve lives.</p>

  <p>Outside of research, I’ve taught and mentored students from all backgrounds — many of whom didn’t believe they “looked like” physicists. I know that feeling. But I also know that when people are supported — when they’re seen and heard — they rise. I’m running for office because our systems don’t reflect that truth. Our politics should work for the people — not for corporations, not for billionaires, but for students, families, teachers, and workers. People like me. People like you.</p>

  <p>I bring to this campaign not just research credentials, but lived experience — with economic hardship, with neurodivergence, and with overcoming systemic barriers. I’ve spent my life solving problems, communicating complex ideas, and standing up for the underdog. That’s exactly what I’ll do in office.</p>

  <h2>Platform</h2>

  <h3>✅ A Green, Just Future</h3>
  <p>We need bold climate leadership now. I support a Green New Deal that invests in renewable energy, creates good-paying union jobs, and ensures no community is left behind in our transition to a sustainable economy. Climate justice is economic, racial, and generational justice.</p>

  <h3>✅ Healthcare Is a Human Right</h3>
  <p>No one should go bankrupt because they got sick. I believe in Medicare for All — a single-payer system that guarantees comprehensive healthcare to every American. It’s time to put people over profits and ensure care, not coverage.</p>

  <h3>✅ Housing for All</h3>
  <p>Everyone deserves a safe, affordable place to call home. I support policies that expand affordable housing, strengthen tenant protections, and invest in public housing. Housing is a human right — not a commodity for corporate profit.</p>

  <h3>✅ Economic Justice</h3>
  <p>I’m fighting for a fair economy that works for working people — not just the wealthy few. That means raising the minimum wage to a living wage, taxing the ultra-rich, protecting the right to organize, and investing in green union jobs.</p>

  <h3>✅ Racial and Social Equity</h3>
  <p>We must dismantle systemic racism across every institution — from policing to education to healthcare. That means investing in marginalized communities, ending mass incarceration, and building systems rooted in justice and dignity.</p>

  <h3>✅ Education for the Many</h3>
  <p>Public education is the foundation of a fair society. I support tuition-free public college and trade school, cancellation of student debt, and robust funding for K–12 schools — especially in under-resourced communities.</p>

  <h3>✅ A Just Foreign Policy</h3>
  <p>America must lead with diplomacy, human rights, and peace — not endless wars. I support a foreign policy grounded in accountability, multilateralism, and justice for oppressed peoples around the world.</p>

  <h3>✅ Democracy That Works for All</h3>
  <p>Our democracy is under threat. I support protecting and expanding voting rights, ending partisan gerrymandering, and getting big money out of politics. It’s time to build a government that answers to the people — not corporations or billionaires.</p>
